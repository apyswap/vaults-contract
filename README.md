# Smart Contracts for APYSwap Vaults

**_Work in progress!!!_**

Vaults if the first product from APYSwap. You can use it to try out the main concept behind APYSwap: tokenized vaults. And at the same time the first users trying this product and locking liquidity there will be rewarded with our APYS token.

## How it works

* Create your own Vault.
* Add liquidity to the Vault, by transferring supported assets to it.
* Lock the Vault for a predefined time interval. The longer the interval the higher the reward.
* While the Vault is locked you can transfer shares of its ownership to other people.
* Once the Vault is unlocked withdraw liquidity from it (plus APYS rewards) according to your share.
